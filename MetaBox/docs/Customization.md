## Fit your own MetaBBO-RL into MetaBox

If you want to develop your own MetaBBO-RL approach, to fit into `MetaBox` running logic, you should meet with the following protocol about the `Agent` and `Optimizer`. 

`Agent` is the same definition in RL area, taking the state from `env` as input and `action` as output. But to fit into MetaBox pre-defined `Trainer` and `Tester` calling logic, `Agent` should has `train_episode` interface which will be called in `Trainer` and `rollout_episode` interface which will be called in `Tester`. 

`Optimizer` is a component of `env` in MetaBBO task. It's controlled by `Agent` and take `action` from `Agent` to perfrom corresponding change like hyper-parameters adjusting or operators selection. But to fit into `env` calling logic. Interfaces namely `init_population` and `update` is needed.

* Your agent should follow this template:

By the way, if you are developing classic optimizer, please refer to [example classic optimizer](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox/tree/main/src/optimizer/deap_de.py).

After that, you should put your own declaring files in directory `src/agent/` and `src/optimizer/` respectively. Then the file structure should be like:

```
src
│        
├─ agent
│   │
│   ├─ de_ddqn_agent.py
│   ├─ ...
│   ├─ rlepso_agent.py
│   └─ my_agent.py
└─ optimizer
    │
    ├─ dq_ddqn_optimizer.py
    ├─ ...
    ├─ rlepso_optimizer.py
    └─ my_optimizer.py
```

In addition, you should register you own agent and backbone optimizer in files `src/agent/__init__.py` and `src/optimizer/__init__.py`. For example, to register the previous class *MyAgent*, you should add one line into the `src/agent/__init__.py` file as below:

```python
from .my_agent import *
```

Meanwhile, you should also import your own agent and backbone optimizer into `src/trainer.py` and `src/tester.py`. Take trainer as an example, you should add two lines into file `src/trainer.py` as follows:

```python
...
# import your agent
from agent import{
     ...
     MyAgent
}
# import your optimizer
from optimizer import{
     ...
     MyOptimizer
}
```

The same action should be done also in `src/tester.py`.

As mentioned, four modes are available:

* `run_experiment` your MetaBBO-RL optimizer.

  `run_experiment` mode implements fully automated workflow. Assume that you've written an agent class named *MyAgent* and a backbone optimizer class named *MyOptimizer*, the entire processes of train, rollout and test can be triggered by running command:

  ```shell
  python main.py --run_experiment --train_agent MyAgent --train_optimizer MyOptimizer --t_optimizer_for_cp DEAP_DE JDE21 DEAP_CMAES Random_search
  ```

  See [Run Experiment](RunExperiment.md) for more details.

* `train` your agent.

  ```shell
  python main.py --train --train_agent MyAgent --train_optimizer MyOptimizer
  ```

  Once you run the above command, the `runName` which is generated based on the run time and benchmark suite will appear at the command line. 

  See [Training](Train.md) for more details.

* `rollout` your agent models.

  Fetch your 21 trained agent models named `checkpointN.pkl` in directory `src/agent_model/train/MyAgent/runName/` and move them to directory `src/agent_model/rollout/MyAgent/`. Rollout the models with train set using:

  ```shell
  python main.py --rollout --agent_load_dir agent_model/rollout/ --agent_for_rollout MyAgent --optimizer_for_rollout MyOptimizer
  ```

  When the rollout ends, check the result data in `src/output/rollout/runName/rollout.pkl` and pick the best model to test.

  See [Rollout](Rollout.md) for more details.

* `test` your MetaBBO-RL optimizer.

  Move the best `.pkl` model file to directory `src/agent_model/test/`, and rename the file to `MyAgent.pkl`. Now use the test set to test `MyAgent` with `DEAP_DE`, `JDE21`, `DEAP_CMAES` and `Random_search`:

  ```shell
  python main.py --test --agent_load_dir agent_model/test/ --agent_for_cp MyAgent --l_optimizer_for_cp MyOptimizer --t_optimizer_for_cp DEAP_DE JDE21 DEAP_CMAES Random_search
  ```

  See [Testing](Test.md) for more details.

Notice that we record 21 checkpoint models during the whole training process. `Rollout` could help you pick the suitable or best model to test and calculate  the metrics.
